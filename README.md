# Multivariate Linear Regression

A machine learning algorithm trained to detect faces of famous people such as Alec Baldwin or Angie Harmon and also trained
to understand if it is looking at a women or a man.

#To Run
1. Run the setup.sh bash script which will populate the faces_subset.txt file with a bunch of links 
   and names to pictures of those actors, provided by FaceScrub.

2. Run the imageScraper.py file which will download all the pictures onto a folder named 'uncropped' and will then 
   crop them to the face and greyscale them. All the processed images will be stored in 'cropped'

3.
